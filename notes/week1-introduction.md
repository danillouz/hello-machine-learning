_Machine Learning_ (ML) is a field that grew out of the
field of _Artificial Intelligence_ (AI). AI allowed to
achieve simple things like finding the shortest point
between two points. But for more complex tasks, like web
search, photo tagging and spam filters, machines require to
learn.

# What is Machine Learning?
> Arthur Samuel: "the field of study that gives computers
the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

> Tom Mitchell: "A computer program is said to learn from
experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and
performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as
measured by P, improves with experience E."

In general, any ML problem can be assigned to one of two
broad classifications:

## Supervised Learning
An algorithm is given a data set in which the _right answers_
were given. This way we already know what our correct output
should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship
between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into:

### Regression problems
Trying to _predict_ results within a _continuous output_.
Meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some
continuous function.

> Regression: statistical process for estimating the
relationships among variables.

> **Continuous** data is **measured** and can take any value
within a range. For example a person's height.

### Classification problems
Trying to _predict_ results in a _discrete output_. Meaning
that we are trying to map input variables into discrete
categories.

> Classification: identifying to which of a set of categories
a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of
data containing observations whose category membership is
known.

> **Discrete** data is **counted** and can only take certain
values. For example the number of students in a class (you
can't have _half_ a student).

## Unsupervised Learning
Allows to approach problems with little or no idea what the
results should look like. Structure can be derived by
_clustering_ the data based on relationships among the
variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the
prediction results, i.e., there is no _teacher_ to correct
you.
